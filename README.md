# python-api-challenge

## Summary

In first part of the challenge, a Python script was created to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across cities.

In second part of the challenge, I used the output from the first part to find suitable locations for vacation based on weather conditions and located the nearest hotel to each city.
